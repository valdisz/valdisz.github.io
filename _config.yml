summary: |
  I’m a system architect and full-stack engineer specializing in secure, large-scale public-sector platforms. I design end-to-end architecture, service journeys, and UIs that consolidate new systems, legacy systems and data into coherent citizen experiences across web and native channels.
  
  My background spans digital identity (OAuth2/OIDC, SSO, PKI with qualified e-signatures), event-driven microservices, and Kubernetes-based platforms with CI/CD, SRE-grade observability, and zero-trust practices. On the front end, I’ve built React component libraries and micro-frontend foundations that let teams ship consistent interfaces independently.
  
  I lead delivery on complex integrations, data interoperability, and standards governance—accelerating safe reuse and reducing time-to-service.
