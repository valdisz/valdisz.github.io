summary: |
  I'm a system architect and full-stack developer located in **Riga, Latvia**, and I like to design systems of any scale and complexity. I have a strong interest in creative programming, particularly generative art.
  
  My primary expertise is in **.Net** and **JavaScript/TypeScript** areas. In recent years I became pretty good with **React** for building complex UIs. I'm open to new languages and technologies and expanding my knowledge stack constantly.
  
  #### Personal and Freelance Projects
  
  Outside of my regular work, I had occasionally worked on several freelance projects, where I got familiar with **Shopify**, **Node.js**, and many other tools and technologies.
  
  In my free time, I run several small personal projects. Some achievements  that are worth mentioning:
  * I have created a realistic fractal game map generator with simple weather simulation for the Atlantis PBEM game;
  * a Web-based game client for the Atlantis PBEM game, which includes complex Human-readable text parsing and representing results in a more digestible form for the game players;
  * artistic star map poster generator;
  * web crawling using **Python** and **.Net**;
  * Data analytics and scientific data processing using various Python tools.
