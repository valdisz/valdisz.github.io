summary: #>
  # <p>I'm a software and web developer.</p>

  # <p>My main expertise is in Python and JavaScript, but I'm open
  # for new languages and technologies and expanding my knowledge
  # stack. I'm using various frameworks, libraries and technologies
  # and trying to choose the best ones for a project (or new for
  # pet-projects). Programming is not only a job for me but also a
  # hobby.</p>

  # <p>I also have experience in Puzzle and Game design, especially
  # in coding puzzles and games. All my projects are located at
  # Github and I actively use it for my work and open source
  # contributions. My free time I spend at competition sites for
  # developers with interesting technical and algorithmic problems.</p>
