summary: |
  I'm a software and web developer. I like to design systems of any scale and lead the team and others to make plans into reality. Although in recent years, I have become more like a captain of the ship and let people do the job instead of trying to do all job by myself. The team will always outperform the sole individualist.

  From a technical angle, my primary expertise is in .Net and JavaScript/TypeScript areas. Recently I became pretty good with React for building complex UIs. But I'm open to new languages and technologies and expanding my knowledge stack.

  I'm using various frameworks, libraries, and technologies and trying to choose the best ones for a project. Programming is not only a job for me but also a hobby.
