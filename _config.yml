summary: |
  I'm a software and web developer. I like to design systems of any scale and lead the team and others to make plans into reality. Although in recent years, I have become more like a captain of the ship and let people do the job instead of trying to do all job by myself. The team will consistently outperform the sole individualist.

  My primary expertise is in .Net and JavaScript/TypeScript areas from a technical angle, but recently I became pretty good with React for building complex UIs. I'm open to new languages and technologies and expanding my knowledge stack.

  I have a strong interest in creative programming, particularly in the generative art area. I'm trying to build a small lifestyle business around this idea, and, to complement my venture, I'm learning digital marketing in my spare time.
